# GerGor
GerGor is a competitive two-player game inspired by the famous "Gershgorin Circle Theorem" (cf. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershgorin_circle_theorem) from Linear Algebra. Each player has a collection of discs in a 2-dimensional plane; by quickly estimating sizes and positions of certain numbers in a matrix, and making an appropriate choice of entry, you transform your discs and try to capture your opponent's. This prototype is written in Python, executes correctly as-is in both version 2.X (for reasonably high X) and version 3.X of Python, and runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac. The GUI is created with GTK+ (cf. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+) and the charming graphics are created with the Pillow fork of the classic PIL library (cf. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library).
