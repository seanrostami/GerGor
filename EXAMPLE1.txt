[caption for EXAMPLE1.png] A typical view. Most of the buttons are disabled because the opponent was playing at the time of this photo. Nonetheless, you can see that certain entries in the matrix are bold -- each serves as the center, on the Horizontal Axis, of the disc corresponding to that row. Two of this player's discs were already captured, and the corresponding rows are now filled with Sad Faces (for some reason, these symbols are very tiny on Windows...). See EXAMPLE2.png for a clearer view of the matrix.
